# FIFAWorldCupPoll

The Conflict: 
How do we create an app that will amplify a futbol fan’s experience during the 2018 World Cup? 
Solution: 
Channel that fan’s passion for the World Cup to vote for who they think will be the overall World Cup Champion! And display votes from other users to either help sway or influence a vote!

Steps: 
API - http://api.football-data.org
Loop through each team and display team names, crests, and matches
New Library = Passport (npm package)
Authentication Requests
Store user vote into MySQL table 
POST and GET Routes to display data 
New Library = AnyChart to pie chart
